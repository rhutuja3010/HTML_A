CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
1. It is used to decorate the html pages.
There are 3 types of CSS
1. Inline CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS



Inline CSS: In this we write the css style along with html tag(element)
We write the Inline css using style attribute of html tags.



<div>: It is used to define the perticular division(part) of page
<div> is block level element. Means the next items appears on next line.



Internal CSS:
In this type of css we defiene the styles inside <head> using
    <style> tag.
The benefit is separation between html and css



Id selector: Using # we create the id selector, and we use this as id to
    html element.
    When we want to apply a style to only 1 html element, we use id selector.
    When we want to apply same style to different html element, we need to
    repeat the code, because we can not give same id to multiple html elements.



   The solution for above problem is class selector
2. Class selector:
    This is created when we want to apply same style to multiple html elements.
